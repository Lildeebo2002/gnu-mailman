<h1>The Secure List Server: an OpenPGP and S/MIME aware Mailman</h1>
<hr/>

<p>This patch is an effort to include OpenPGP and S/MIME support in Mailman, as
part of the Secure List Server project.  The project is made possible by <a
href="http://www.nlnet.nl/">NLnet</a>.</p>

<p>The Secure List Server project's home is at <a
href="http://non-gnu.uvt.nl/mailman-pgp-smime/">
http://non-gnu.uvt.nl/mailman-pgp-smime/</a>.  Sources are available from <a
href="http://non-gnu.uvt.nl/pub/mailman/">http://non-gnu.uvt.nl/pub/mailman/</a>.</p>

<p>New versions of this patch will be announced on the <a
href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-developers">Mailman
developers list</a></p>

<p>This is Mailman <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1167696&amp;group_id=103&amp;atid=300103">patch
#1167696</a>.</p>

<p>Beware!  This code is not mature, and not yet suitable for production use.
Inspect the code to find out if it's good enough for you.</p>


<h2>Specs</h2>

<p>This patch handles both RFC 2633 (S/MIME) and RFC 2440 (OpenPGP) email
messages.</p>

<p>A post will be distributed only if the PGP (or S/MIME) signature on the post
is from one of the list members.</p>

<p>For sending encrypted email, a list member encrypts to the public key of the
list.  The post will be decrypted and re-encrypted to the public keys of all
list members.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this, each list has a public and private key.  (These
private keys can optionally be protected by passphrases.) Furthermore, new list
settings are defined:</p>

<ul>
 <li>gpg_post_encrypt: Are postings which are encrypted with the GPG list key
  decrypted?  Are subcribers forced to encrypt their posts?</li>
 <li>gpg_distrib_encrypt: Are posts encrypted to the subscribers GPG public key
  before being distributed?  Is such encryption (and uploading of a public
  key) mandatory?</li>
 <li>gpg_post_sign: Should posts be GPG signed with an acknowledged subscriber
  key before being distributed?</li>
 <li>gpg_distrib_sign: Should the server sign messages with the list key
  before distributing?</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar settings are defined for S/MIME.</p>

<p>Finally, each subscriber can upload her PGP and S/MIME public key using the
webinterface.</p>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Additional requirements: gpg binary in path of qrunner, GnuPGInterface
python library from <a
href="http://py-gnupg.sourceforge.net/">http://py-gnupg.sourceforge.net/</a>
and (for now) openssl.</p>


<h3>upgrading from earlier and/or unpatched versions</h3>

<p>PGP and S/MIME support needs to store additional information for the mailing
lists, thus new variables were introduced. Have a look at bin/update and search
for "GPG" and "smime".</p>

<p>The automatic upgrade procedure occuring on a change of the version number
is implemented yet untested.  You can either modify the version number in
Version.py to trigger the automatic patch, or run bin/update --force (worked
for me, but I won't give any guarantees).</p>

<h3>fresh installs</h3>

<p>If you're installing on a Debian(-based) hosts, you can "apt-get install"
the patched package from</p>

<pre>
deb http://non-gnu.uvt.nl/debian sarge mailman
</pre>

<p>If you're on another platform, you can apply <a
href="http://non-gnu.uvt.nl/pub/mailman/">the patch</a> to a pristine official
mailman tarball, and install using the official installation instructions.</p>

<h3>setting up lists</h3>

<p>Create a list. Go to the admin menu.  Open "Privacy options", select "GPG
options" and "S/MIME options". Make the settings appropriate for your list
(yes, there is some help text!).  Create a keypair for your list.  Make sure
the list-posting-address is in one of the keys identities.  Publish the public
key for your list, e.g. on the list info page.  Ask all subscribers to upload
their public key.  A good idea is to set up the web interface to only run over
https.</p>

<p>Very likely, you'd prefer "Confirm and approve" as subscribe_policy (Privacy
Options; Subscribtion Rules).</p>

<p>Very likely, you'd prefer "No" for archive (Archiving Options): no effort
was made to do something "sane" w.r.t. the archiving of encrypted posts.  Just
don't archive.</p>

<p>Subscribers who do not upload their public keys will miss posts.  Errors
show up in <code>/var/log/mailman/smtp-failure</code>:</p>

<pre>Mar 24 15:29:28 2005 (5267) delivery to joe@example.com failed with
  code 550: Encryption forced, but no keys found</pre>

<p>Tell your subscribers where to upload their keys: list Info Page,
Subscribers section. Visit "Subscriber List", choose your address, list
membership configuration, "Your GPG key for postings".</p>

<p>Distribute the list public key to your subscribers, e.g. by posting it to
the list after they've subscribed, or by pasting it in "[General Options],
info" in the list admin webinterface.</p>

<h3>l10n</h3>

<p>I only updated the english html template for the user preferences;
that means that users using a different language setting will be unable
to upload their public key. Either allow English only, or make the
patches to other language templates (and send the diff to me).</p>

<h3>lost emails</h3>

<p>Users <em>won't get warnings</em> when mails are not delivered to them due
to the encryption send policy. Failures to send due to a missing public key
will be treated like bounces.</p>

<!--
<p>If you'd like your changes to get imported in
<code>http://non-gnu.uvt.nl/repos/mailman-ssls</code>, so that your stuff will
get incorporated in the pgp-smime patch, you have some options:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Publish your patches using darcs: set up a repository, readable by Joost
van Baal (the current maintainer of the repository on
<code>non-gnu.uvt.nl</code>).  Mail the ssls-devel list once you have some
interesting stuff, ready for importing: Joost will run <code>darcs
pull</code>;</li>
 <li>Sent patches by email, using darcs (run <code>darcs record</code> and
<code>darcs send</code>, so that your patch is ready for
<code>darcs apply</code>) or using traditional unified diff
format;</li>
 <li>Commit to the repository on <code>non-gnu.uvt.nl</code> directly.  You
can get write access either after asking and getting granted access, or after
being invited and accepting access.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please split contributions and patches in small bits: one patch for each
functional change please.  This helps people who'd like to apply just a subset
of your patches.</p> -->


<h2>History, credits, copyright</h2>

<p>This patch is based upon <a
href="http://medien.informatik.uni-ulm.de/~stefan/gpg-mailman.html">prior work
by Stefan Schlott</a> in mailman-2.1.5-gpg_2005-02-22.diff.gz.  Copyright on
the code is held by Stefan Schlott (stuff from
mailman-2.1.5-gpg_2005-02-22.diff.gz) and <a href="http://www.uvt.nl/">Tilburg
University</a> (stuff written by Joost van Baal), see the individual files for
details.  Some contributions are from <a href="http://www.feiri.de/">Michael
Feiri</a>.</p>

<p>Biggest lumps of changes by Joost van Baal are in Mailman/GPGUtils.py
(function verifyMessage added) and in Mailman/Handlers/Moderate.py (code which
deals with gpg_post_sign added).  These are likely nontrivial so
copyright-able.  Check with a specialist if you'd like to know for sure.
Likely, Mailman upstream wants a copyright assignment to FSF before patch gets
included.</p>

<p>In 2005, this project was known as the SURFnet Secure List Server
(mailman-ssls).  <a href="http://www.surfnet.nl/">SURFnet</a> and <a
href="http://www.uvt.nl/">Tilburg University</a> made the project possible.
Since 2008, the project is made possible by <a
