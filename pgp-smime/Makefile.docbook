# this Makefile needs caspar-20020313.tar.gz (or higher). caspar 20030716 makes
# it look even better.  get it from http://mdcc.cx/caspar/ .

# based upon http://non-gnu.uvt.nl/pub/uvt-unix-doc/packaging/Makefile

#
# usage:
#  make typeset; make install
#

# force utf-8 support.  the environment-variable is needed: we've tested
# that...
JADE = SP_ENCODING="utf-8" jade -b utf-8
# ps and pdf work fine with Ã© and stuff

# html typesetting will yield a utf-8-encoded html file.  the html source
# will _not_ have a header stating so.  therefore, likely your webserver
# needs to publish in utf-8 by default.

# FIXME
#  PRINT_DSL = print.dsl
#  HTML_DSL = html.dsl
